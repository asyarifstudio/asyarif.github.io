I've been building my blog many times, from wordpress, to blogspot, to hosted wordpress with my own domain, and even custom blog built from scratch with angular. But many times also it's not maintained.

I lost many of my previous articles because of that. well I guess losing is part of growth so I guess that's the part that I can learn through this process.

But now I comeback again after reading about people hosting their blog using github. After couple of googling here and there, I finally learn about it and how to use github page + jekyll to create static website for blog.

Well, let see now how it's going to unfold. I hope this time I can maintain this blog
